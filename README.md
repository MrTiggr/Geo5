HTML5 + Geo = Geo5 :: Interactive maps using HTML5 data tags, no coding!

**Geo5** is a JavaScript library that makes it easier to create rich, HTML5 Mapping applications. It uses *observers* to make your UI automatically stay in sync with an underlying data model, along with a powerful and extensible set of *declarative bindings* (based upon KnockoutJS) to enable productive development.

##Getting started
